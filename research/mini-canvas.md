## Evidence

In 1 sentence, what is the evidence you will collect and how does that answer the RQ?

## Market/Practical audience

What are the names of partners (customers, who may or may not be users) who would experience this problem or be interested in the solution you will build.

## Research Audience

## Research Background

In one sentence, what is the most relevant thing the research community knows about how to solve the problem

## Broader Impact

In one sentence, who are other (specific people) that would be interested in using the solution that you could test with? I one sentence, what is the broader impact
