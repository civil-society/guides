# Asking for Help

People generally want to help each other. Asking for help is a skill.

- **Specific**: Make your ask clear. If you’re looking for feedback on a section, what kind of feedback are you looking for (e.g., do you need to shorten a section? Do you believe the argument?)?
- **Direct**: Use an active voice, “Can you help me with…?” instead of “I was wondering if…” or “It would be great if you could…” to avoid unclear requests
- **Timely**: By when do you need a response, decision, or help? Being clear about expected timeline will maximize the chance that your request is completed by the time you need it
- **Scoped**: Make sure that your ask is reasonably scoped for your audience. Think about how much time it would take the person to complete your request and make and scope your help appropriately. If you’re making an unscoped request (e.g., “Can you help me find evidence for X?”, make sure you set a time expectation – “Can you spend 15 min looking for evidence to support X?”) – you just want to make sure your collaborator knows when they are done with
- **Personal**: Why are you asking this person specifically for help? What expertise does the person have that you would benefit from? Reflecting on this often makes me think of different people/resources I have that might be better fitting for getting the help I need.
- **Short**: Keep the request short.

> Hi X!

> Can I get your feedback on my introduction by the end of the week? Your expertise on X would be tremendously valuable to this section about X!
> Specifically, I'm looking for:
>
> - **Length**: I need to cut 1 page from the paper, what would you recommend cutting?
> - **Logic**: Can you follow my argument? If not, where did I lose you?
> - **Evidence**: Does the work I cite provide enough support for my claims? If not, do you have suggestions on what work I should look into?
>
> Let me know if you're able to help with this!
>
> Thank you!
